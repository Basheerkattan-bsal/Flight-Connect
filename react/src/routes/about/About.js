            When we started in 2003, we set out to do things differently. We
            wanted to show all flight options in one place, creating a simple
            alternative to the confusing sites that make travel feel like hard
            work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward to today and we’/ve gone from a flight search engine to
            a global leader in travel. We're proud that more than 100 million
            people across the world (that's quite a few!) rely on our app and
            website each month to help them with their travel plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dedicated to making travel as simple as possible, we help each and
            every one of them find the best options across flights, hotels, and
            car rentals to book the perfect trip.

            Travel is all about freedom. So it makes sense that planning and
            booking your trip should be simple, not a chore.
          </p>
          <p>
            We know you're looking for the best prices and most flexibility, to
            choose what's right for you. Which is why we're always hard at work
            to make sure our app and website are super straightforward and
            efficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Choose where you want to go, when you want to go, and get the very
            best price from thousands of sites, without having to look anywhere
            else. Plus, check out all the ways we can help you find a trip
            that's tailored to what you’re looking for, no matter your travel
            style or your budget.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feeling flexible? Search ‘Everywhere’ to see where you can go for a
            great price. Got a destination in mind? Use our Price Alerts to find
            out when prices change.
          </p>
          <p>
            And once you know when and where you’re going, book in just a few
            quick steps, whether on our app or website -- both of which are
            available in more than 30 languages.

            Travel is one of life's greatest pleasures. And we want each
            generation to be able to experience that joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We give you all the options so that you can make the decision that’s
            right for you. That includes our 'Greener choice' label, which
            highlights the flights that emit less CO2 and we’ve already helped
            more than 10 million travelers select flights with the lowest
            emissions for their route.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s just the start, but we’re serious about sustainability and
            holding ourselves accountable. We buy sustainable aviation fuel
            (SAF) to help offset any travel we do here at Skyscanner. We're a
            team that's committed to discovering new ways to explore the world
            in a way that benefits both people and places.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also know we can’t solve this challenge alone. That's why we’re
            working with the Duke of Sussex and industry leaders, to form
            Travalyst. Together, we’re a catalyst for change, committed to
            helping everyone explore our world for generations to come.
